1. A volume is a namespaces.
   >> All the snapshots and clones from the volume and it's snapshots should also be part of the namespace.
   
2. Each of the versions have their own root nodes.
   >> Each of those nodes shares metadata. With the pervious snapshotted versions (or the parent clones).
   
3. There is a concept of hierarchical refcounting.
   >> The refcount map is kept outside the data/metadata of the volume-namespace.
   >> Doing that de-couples space-accounting and actual metadata which is needed for a volume.
   >> The mainly needed metadata for a volume is identified as indirect blocks.
