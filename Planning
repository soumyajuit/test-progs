1. A volume is a namespaces.
   >> All the snapshots and clones from the volume and it's snapshots should also be part of the namespace.
   
2. Each of the versions have their own root nodes.
   >> Each of those nodes shares metadata. With the pervious snapshotted versions (or the parent clones).
   
3. There is a concept of hierarchical refcounting.
   >> The refcount map is kept outside the data/metadata of the volume-namespace.
   >> Doing that de-couples space-accounting and actual metadata which is needed for a volume.
   >> The mainly needed metadata for a volume is identified as indirect blocks.
   
   
4. Let's consider following

   >> 
   [1] (v1) --> Indirect block 1 at v1
   [ 1, 2 , 3, 4](v1)  --> blocks 1-4 at v1
   
   Now there is a write to block 2 in v2  then following would happen
   
   
   V1                      v2
   [1]                     [x1]
   [1, 2, 3, 4]            [1, x2, 3, 4]
   
   After write.
   
   V1                      v2
   [1]                     [x1]
   [1, 2, 3, 4]            [1, x2, 3, 4]


   Here all the blocks which were not written is getting shared but the block 2 which is replaces by x2 and the indirect block at the same manner
   changed to x1
   
   
5. Virtual BLock Number:
   >> Each block which hosted under the volume namespace will contain a virtual block number ( the formatting of it is not decided yet).
   >> There may be a 1:1 association between a VBN and PBN ( Physical block number) and in some cases that might not be there because of
      Dedup.
      
6. The refcount map is a map which contains...
    >> A key is a VBN and value is refcount.
    >> Implicite refcount of 1 is present in the refcount map. Hence
        >> If map.find(VBN) returns empty that means either block is not present or the block has a refcount of 1.
        
7. The Representation is kept as B-plus tree.
   >> The actual DATA contains in the leaf nodes. The rest are only indirect-nodes.
   >> An indirect-node is also considered as the data ( meta-data) of the Volume namespace.
   >> If and indirect block of level L has refcount C then all the nodes underneath it will have
      refcount == C.
8. Point 7 established the point of hierarchical refcounting.
